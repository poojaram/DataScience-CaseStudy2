# Foundational Stats

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that you have a foundational understanding of probability and statistics such that you can appropriately interpret and perform analyses. The [open-intro-stats](open-intro-stats.pdf) textbook included in this repository is the **strongly suggested** resource for answering questions (i.e., rather than wikipedia / misc. google searches.). You are welcome to use other resources or prior knowledge, but we expect your answers to be consistent (and as **thorough**) as captured in the book. Obviously, we **do not expect** you to read the entire book, but instead to **use it as a reference** to guide you through answering the following questions.

## Probability Basics (Ch. 2)
For each of the following questions, compute the answer. Then, using the appropriate vocabulary, describe how you computed you answer in ~1 - 2 sentences

1. What is the probability of rolling an odd number _or_ a 4 if you roll a (fair) six-sided die? _(5 points)_

2. What is the probability of rolling an odd number _or_ a 4 in **two rolls** of a (fair) six-sided die? May require outside reference. _(5 points)_

3. Imagine a bowl with three balls in it: one red, one blue, and one yellow. What is the probability of removing a red ball from the  bowl (without replacing it), _and then_ removing a yellow ball? _(5 points)_

4. Example 2.54 (p.98) walks through the use of **Bayes' Theorem** to answer the question, _what is the probability that a woman has breast cancer given her positive mammogram results_? In addition to the false positive/negative test rate, what other information is necessary to compute this probability? _(5 points)_


## Probability Distributions (Ch. 3)
1. What are the **parameters** of the normal distribution, and how does changing each one affect the shape of the distribution? _(5 points)_

2. If the distribution of a variable is normal (or nearly normal) what does that empower us to do? _(5 points)_

3. Imagine two instructors that teach the same course, both of whom have a normal distribution for their students' grades. In the first instructor's course, the mean student grade is 93%, with a standard deviation of 8%. In the second instructor's course, the mean student grade is 90%, with a standard deviation of 5%. For the students below, What **percentile** of performance did each student achieve (and was, therefore, the "better" student)? _(5 points)_

    - Student 1: received a 96% in Instructor 1's class
    - Student 2: received a 93% in Instructor 2's class

4. Imagine you have a job registering people to vote, and you need to register one more person before the end of the day. Based on your work thus far, you know that each person you approach has a **4% probability** of registering to vote with you. What is the **expected number of people** you need to approach before you're likely to get someone to register? Please also include the **standard deviation** around your estimate, and describe how you arrive at your answer, making sure to reference the **type of distribution** this event follows. _(5 points)_

5. Continuing from the example above, if I approached 100 people to register to vote, what is the probability that **exactly 4** would register?  What is the **expected number** of people to register? _hint: even though this is the same situation, the questions being asked may be of different distributions_. _(5 points)_

## Foundations for Inference (Ch. 4)
1. Define the terms **standard error** and **standard deviation**. Then, using a hypothetical example _not in the textbook_, describe a situation in which you could compute the two, and highlight how they are different (hint: your answer should include a description of how to generate a **sampling distribution**).  _(5 points)_

2. Why is the number 1.96 used for calculating confidence intervals? _(5 points)_

3. Given the statement, "the mean height of a sample of students was 140cm, with a confidence interval of 130 - 150 cm", interpret the **meaning of the confidence interval**. _(5 points)_

4. Imagine you want to evaluate the claim, _the average income for Informatics graduates is $40,000_. If a sample of 200 Informatics graduates returns a mean of $42,000 (sd = $10,000), can we _reject the null hypothesis_ that the average income is not $40,000? Assume you're using confidence intervals as a mechanism for evaluating your hypothesis. _(5 points)_

## Statistical Inference (Ch. 5)

1. Define the **t-distribution**, then describe how it is different from the normal distribution, and why it would be used for analysis.  _(5 points)_
